Note: CNS is designed to run on a GPU, but can also run without one (much more slowly).  These instructions are written assuming you have a GPU.  If you don't, skip any steps written in <I>italics</I> and also read <A HREF="#nogpu">this section</A>.<P>

<LI><I>(Linux only.) Consider setting your GPU(s) to "exclusive access" mode to ensure that they will only allow one model at a time to run.  Usually, trying to run multiple models on one GPU results in out-of-GPU-memory errors.  Setting exclusive access avoids this.  In multi-GPU systems, this setting also allows CNS to automatically select a GPU that isn't being used.  Under other operating systems, GPU selection must currently be managed manually.  See the NVIDIA documentation for how to specify exclusive access under Linux.</I><P>

Perform the following instructions for any packages you intend to use with CNS.

<LI>Compile the package using the command <CODE>"cns_build <I>package</I>"</CODE>, where <I>package</I> is the package name.  Normally this will be the same as the directory name.  All file names in the package directory also start with the package name.
